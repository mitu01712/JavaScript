<h1>JS - Introduction to Loops</h1>
<p>the repetition of code is called iteration In another words, running the same Lines of code for a certain number of times is called loop</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Say you are having a party and you have a guest list which has the names of all your friends. Now, the problem is that you don't remember if you invited a certain friend say "Darth Vader".</p>

<h3>Loop in JavaScript</h3>
<p>javascript offers you two loops - while Loop and For Loop</p>

<p>When you know, how many times your loop needs to iterate then you can use For Loop.</p>

<p>When you have the kind of loop where you need to stop the loop based on certain condition, you can use while loop</p>
